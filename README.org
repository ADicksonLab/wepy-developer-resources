* Wepy Developer Group

This repo will serve as the central organizational place for
organizing the development of wepy as an ecosystem, including the
contributed modules.

Specific discussion and issue tracking should be done in each repo.

Decisions about:

- merging between repos
- deprecating repos
- creating new repos
- placing of new content by repo

Will be done in the issues for this project.
